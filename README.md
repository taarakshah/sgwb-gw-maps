# sgwb-gw-maps

This repo summarizes Taarak's contribution to the SGWB/GW cross-correlation project. In this project, I forced correlation between the two maps and simulated 10,000 different maps with information about the covariance matrix for our multivariate normal distribution, then calculated the power of detecting cross-correlation under our different simulated distributions of a measure called the "coherence". The coherence serves as our metric to determine if cross-correlation is present. The results of these simulations are present in the notebook "Force_correlation.ipynb". The final results are currently being collected and put into a final paper in conjunction with the University of Minnesota School of Statistics and the School of Astrophysics. This research project was completed with Sara Algeri, Vuk Mandic, Claudia Scarlata, Brendan King, and Angelo Rustichini, all from the University of Minnesota.
